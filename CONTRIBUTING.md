## Reporting Issues

A great way to contribute to the project is to send a detailed report when you encounter an issue. We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report, and will thank you for it!

Check that [our issue database](https://github.com/remind101/empire/issues) doesn't already include that problem or suggestion before submitting an issue. If you find a match, add a quick "+1" or "I have this problem too." Doing this helps prioritize the most common problems and requests.

Please also include the steps required to reproduce the problem if possible and applicable. This information will help us review and fix your issue faster.

## Submitting Pull Requests

We want the development of Empire to be driven by the needs of the community, so pull requests are highly encouraged. We do have some guidelines that we would like people to follow:

* If your change is non-trivial, or implements a new feature, please create an issue first so the community and maintainers can discuss the change before implementation happens.

When submitting a pull request, here are some things to keep in mind:

* Is your change backwards compatible? Would this require any migration steps? Will any changes be required in the [CLI](https://github.com/remind101/empire/tree/master/cmd/emp)?
* Does your change require changes to the documentation? Does the quickstart guide need to be updated?
* Did you add appropriate test coverage? Submissions that add features or change core functionality will not be accepted without sufficient tests. We favor stability over anything else.
* Did you update the CHANGELOG?
